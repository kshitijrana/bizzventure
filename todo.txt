Note: there was another folder called includes in the public folder, I have deleted it and changed all the corresponding entries. i doubt "all". just cross check again

Things to do:
1. Add front end design to the final.html page
2. Test the portal extensively (No time though)
3. Before making any changes to the add_to_database.php file, please add comments about what you're doing
5. add_to_database.php unsets the session at the last. so if the user will try to go back from final.html, it'll be a huge problem.
5. find a solution to 5 if possible
6. delete only those fields in every form where something would be incorrect (if you have time ofcourse)

Before uploading:
1. change the idea descrption fields limit to 100 in the pattern attribute. Also, change the value to 100 in the check_idea2_variables() and check_idea3_variables() in included_functions.php
2. oh and, don't forget to delete this file too.
